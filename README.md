# TwitchAutoLurk
Open a muted tab when a streamer you want to support goes live.

Click the chrome widget to manage your "Lurked" streams.

I'm not 100% sure you'll count as a viewer unless you actively click the tab and wait for playback.

Right click the tab and select unmute if you want to actually watch the stream.

Please don't hold me liable if this is against twitch Terms Of Service.

# Install

I'll submit to google store when i'm done testing so for now:

1. Hit download zip to the right
2. Go to chrome://extensions
3. Tick "Developer Mode"
4. Navigate to downloaded and extracted zip folder
5. Done
